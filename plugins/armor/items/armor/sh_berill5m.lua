Designed for intense rapid-insertion assault operations, this outfit is standard issue for most Spetsnaz operators in the Zone, but requires a high quality respirator to counteract its weaknesses against radiation and anomalies. Occasionally, this suit finds its way into the black market via raided supply convoys and corrupt officials."
